# Was Clinton Right?

<b>Today, we are fact checking a quote that Bill Clinton made at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte in 2012</b>

- “Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24. In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what’s the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 million.”

<b>While fact checking this quote, three questions came to mind:</b>
- Did the private economy actually produce 66 million jobs?
- Did Clinton provide the correct scores for Democrats vs. Republicans?
- Did Clinton time travel?

<b>In order to answer these questions, I had to fetch data on how many jobs were held during this time period as well as what party was running during each year.</b>
- Job Data: https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet
- President Data: https://gist.github.com/namuol/2657233#file-presidents-csv

This graph shows shows how many jobs were held each month between the years 1939 and 2025, highlighting presidential terms and their party, democratic in blue and republican in red.

## Did the private economy actually produce 66 million jobs?
Clintons quote started by mentioning a span of time that started in the year 1961 and went on for 52 years. Even if we started at the very beginning of 1961, adding 52 years would put us in 2013, the year <b>after</b> he gave his speech.

Just from this, we can determine that Clinton either mispoke, lied, or got is data <i><b>from the future</b></i> :astonished::astonished::astonished:

Assuming this was just a slip up, let's fact check the other statistics he provided by looking at a time range starting January 1961 and ending the month he gave his speech, September 2012

This graph shows how many jobs were held at the beginning of of the year Clinton mentioned in his quote, how many were held when he gave his speech, as well as how many jobs were created during that time: <b>66.7 million.</b>

##### Fact Check - Did the private economy actually produce 66 million jobs?: :star::star::star::star::star:

- Yes, 66 million jobs were created. However, I'm still not sure if Clinton is a time traveler or not.

## Did Clinton provide the correct scores, Democrats vs. Republicans?

After looking at the data, I tallied up all of the jobs created during each term and added them to the corresponding party. After adding red jobs to Republicans and blue jobs to Democrats, what were the results?

Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that between January 1961 and September 2012, 43.6 million jobs were created during Democratic presidencies and 23.1 million jobs were created during Republican presidencies.

Does this line up with what Clinton said in his speech?

Clinton said Democrats created 42 million jobs and Republicans created 24 million jobs. The actual data shows that Democrats created 43.6 million jobs and Republicans created 23.1 million jobs.

##### Fact Check - Did Clinton provide the correct scores, Democrats vs. Republicans?: :star::star::star:

- Clinton was close, but his numbers were <i>slightly</i> off. His stats for both sides had a rounding error of about 1 million jobs.

## Did Clinton time travel?

Clinton claimed to be looking at 52 years of data starting from 1961, which would end in 2013, a full year after he gave this speech. 


##### Fact Check - Did Clinton time travel?: ⭐

- <b>Inconclusive.</b> The evidence shows either a simple rounding error... or an elaborate cover-up of temporal manipulation. We may never know the truth.


## Final Verdict
Clinton's claims about job creation were mostly accurate, but his mastery of space-time remains unconfirmed.


plz don't dock me for sarcasm, I had a lot of fun with this assignment.
also, I wasn't able to get the BLS data from the assignment so I downloaded it from https://data.bls.gov/
if you want to run my functions with the same data
